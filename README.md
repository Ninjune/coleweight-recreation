# coleweight-recreation
Coleweight bot for https://discord.gg/mining & backend for my site https://ninjune.dev.
## Setup:
- Requires nodejs, I'm using v16.18.0, idk what it's compatible with.
- Clone directory and do "npm install" in the folder.
- Change "default-config.json" to "config.json".
- Make a disc bot.
- Fill in values in config.json.
- Delete csvs if want to reset them (leave cwinfo)
- Run start.bat
(I've probably forgotten something)
